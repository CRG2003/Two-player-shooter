A simple 2 player shooter made in my first year of university to grasp the basics of the untiy game engine as well as some basic game design principles.

This module was my introduction to game engines such as unity and involved creating multiple enemy types for the top down shooter, a boss enemy with varying attacks and even a time freezing mechanic as well as being able to switch between the two playable characters. 

Module grade: 86 / 100
